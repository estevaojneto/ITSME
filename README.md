# ITSME
# Information Technology Study Material Examples

As IT workers we all can expect certain questions to pop up during interviews. Not simply "how can you contribute to this company?" or "what's your opinion on your previous employer", but rather questions that are meant to test your knowledge in programming logic, and it is far from uncommon to see programmers with a lot of experience [sic] failing simple tests, such as FizzBuzz.

# So what is this about?

I've decided to make a repository with the most common questions you'd expect to hear from the HR department of IT companies. This is quite a pet project that will eventually grow into a lot of code, which can be used for you to study if you're a student, or as a proof of my competency if you're a recruiter ;). The code is mostly self-explanatory, although I did include some comments to help clarify certain choices or optimizations.

# Did I do *all* of this?

Pseudocode /was/ looked at as a reference in more complex algorithms, but absolutely *no* code was copied and pasted from the internet at all. This is not what studying is about.
