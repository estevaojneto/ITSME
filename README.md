# ITSME
# Information Technology Study Material Examples

As IT workers we all can expect certain questions to pop up during interviews. Not simply "how can you contribute to this company?" or "what's your opinion on your previous employer", but rather questions that are meant to test your knowledge in programming logic, and it is far from uncommon to see programmers with a lot of experience [sic] failing simple tests, such as FizzBuzz.

# So what is this about?

I've decided to make a repository with the most common questions you'd expect to hear from the HR department of IT companies. This is quite a pet project that will eventually grow into a lot of code, which can be used for you to study. The code is mostly self-explanatory, although I did include some comments to help clarify certain choices or optimizations.

# The format

Every source file included starts with a common question posed by HR such as "Create a program that counts from x to y (where x > y) and prints whether each number is odd or even". I believe those can be compiled with most C-family compilers out there, but I personally use the latest stable version of GCC, Python and an online JS interpreter, so that's what I use to test.
